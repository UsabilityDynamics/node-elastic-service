ElasticSearch Client
====================
ElasticSearch Client for Node.js

This is currently under development! This module currently lacks the following:

    - tests
    - documentation
    - examples

If you are NOT looking for a module to actually LAUNCH ElasticSearch, but only for a module to
interact with an ElasticSearch instance that is already started, you may want to look into using
Elastical, which is a great module.

This module is being developed for starting, stopping updating, installing plugins, and monitoring an actual
ElasticSearch instance. Of course once an instante is started, an API is available for making requests,
much like with Elastical.

Example Usage
-------------
One other fundamental difference between ESC and Elastical is I use Events like they're going out of style.

To create a new ElasticSearch, instantiate the module using the start() method.

    // Instantiate.
    var Instance = require( 'elastic-client' ).start({
      'path': '/usr/local/something/bin/elasticsearch',
      'node.name': 'Example-Node',
      'http.port': 9200,
      'path.data': './data_storage',
      'path.work': './work_directory',
      'path.logs': './logs_directory',
      'cluster.name': 'Example-Cluster'
    });

The "path" property should be the absolute path to the ES binary. This module will attempt to find an
ES instance using the "which" command if no path is specified.

Any ElasticSearch option can be passed into the .start() method, simply using dot-notation.
In one of the next releases I'll add support for an Object to be passed in for the settings,

Below are some example of using events to monitor ElasticSearch.

    // ES Instance Started
    Instance.on( 'node.started', function() { console.log( 'ElasticSearch started.', this.pid });

    // Example of Wildcard usage - will trigger on any event related to the ES node.
    Instance.on( 'node.*', function() { console.log( 'Some ElasticSearch "node" event:', this.event, this.pid });

    // Some Critical Failure
    Instance.on( 'error', function( error ) { console.error( error ); });

    // Forward ALL data output by the ElasticSearch terminal.
    Instance.on( 'process.data', function( data ) { console.log( data });

Once Instantiated, you may utilize interact with the instance by making standard HTTP requests, or via the
ESC API.

    // Index a Document (WIP)
    Instance.Document.index( 'the_index', 'the_type', {
      title: "Welcome to my stupid blog",
      en_us: "Blah blah."
    }).on( 'success', [some_callback_function] );

    // Save type to a variable (WIP)
    var some_type = Instance.Type.get( 'some_index', 'some_type' );

    // Access documents within type via variable (WIP)
    some_type.Document.get( 234234 ).on( 'loaded', [callback] );

Events
------
The module utlizes numerous events for interacting and monitoring ElasticSearch instance. Each instance of ESC
utilizes EventEmitter2 to handle events allowing for the use of the wildcart character; all events are
delimited with a period.

    - node.started - ElasticSearch instance started.
    - node.stopped - ElasticSearch instance stopped.
    - process.data - ElasticSearch proecess' console output.
    - process.error - ElasticSearch process' error.
    - error - General Instance error.
